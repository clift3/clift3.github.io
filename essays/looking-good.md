I'm not confident in coming up with good design. However, I know a good design when I see one (at least I'd like to think I do). One approach I like to take when coming up with a design is throwing things on to the screen and then fiddling with them as I go. Many small changes later and hopefully I have a decent design set up.

All those small changes can become tedious though, so streamlining that process will save a lot of time. Having a UI Framework potentially does just that. It changes the html and css code to something more in tune with design ideas. "I want a menu that goes across the top here with a couple of dropdowns." Having a UI framework can make implementing that relatively painless (along with the subsequent deletion).
Of course, you can still sprinkle in a bit of html and css for fine adjustments, but a UI framework will help you to get that concept on screen right away.
